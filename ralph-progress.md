# Ralph Progress Log

## Iteration 36
- Started Group Scholar Donor Briefs, a Ruby CLI that turns donation exports into donor briefs with top donors, lapsed flags, campaign mix, and pledge coverage.
- Implemented `donor_briefs.rb` with CSV parsing, summary stats, lapsed and pledge logic, and JSON export.
- Added sample data and README usage notes.
